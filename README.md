# JS Unit Testing with Jest

This example project is written in Node, and tested with Jest.

### The assignment
Some tests are failing. Fixing this up will make the tests green.

### Setup command
`npm install`

### Run command
`npm test`

### Install Jest Runner in VS Code

For easier testing, install [Jest Runner VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner)

This extension identifies individual Jest tests and puts a "Run|Debug" menu above each test.

### Notes
- It is best not to push changes to GitHub until you know your tests pass
- The above note does not stop you from doing separate commits each time you make a fix
